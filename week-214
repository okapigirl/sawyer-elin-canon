# WEEK 214 — Post-Wedding, Early COVID, Conception Shift

**Date Range:** April 13-19, 2020  
**Gap Since Last Scene:** 6 weeks (Week 207 wedding; Weeks 208-213 post-wedding integration + early COVID lockdown began mid-March)  
**Current Life Phase:** Married baseline settling, early COVID isolation, shift to deliberate conception attempts, house construction adapting to restrictions

## What He Tells People (Social Version)

"Got married at the end of February. Then COVID lockdown happened basically immediately after. Now we're figuring out what married and isolated looks like. Trying for a baby too, actually."

*[Why this version: True but surface. Doesn't mention Pack coordination through isolation, the deliberate timing conversation, house delays, the emotional weight of starting parenthood-building during a pandemic, her fear of slipping into her mother's overwhelm pattern.]*

## What He Actually Thinks About (Private Version)

Married for 6 weeks and then the world locked down. They were "not preventing" since October (6 months), natural timeline, no pregnancy yet. Post-wedding they had the conversation: keep it natural, or shift to more deliberate timing?

They chose deliberate. Not obsessive—not tracking temperature or ovulation apps—but intentional. Sex timed around her cycle, awareness of windows, the contract shifting from "open to it" to "actively working toward it." The sexual contract operationalized.

COVID complicates everything: Pack can't be in person, house construction is delayed or adapted, and he's tracking her emotional state more carefully through lockdown stress. She's worried about slipping into her mother's overwhelm pattern, disappearing into parenthood-anxiety before there's even a kid. He's watching to make sure she doesn't disappear.

Still not pregnant. Cycle tracking just started. They're in the 6-month to 1-year realistic window. No pressure, but aware that time is passing and intention matters now.

## Core Memory Architecture (For Future Writing)

**The sensory flash (what he feels without thinking):**
- Married 6 weeks when lockdown hits, everything stopped and shifted
- Sex continues but now with timing awareness, cycle tracking, intention
- Her checking in with herself (parental overwhelm fear) daily, sometimes multiple times
- Pack distant, video calls only, the quad infrastructure suddenly remote-only
- House construction paused or heavily restricted, uncertainty about timeline
- The strangeness of "everything is locked down and we're actively trying for a baby"
- His hands on her during sex feeling like anchor, reassurance that she's still there
- Her trusting him with the timing information, the cycles, the waiting

**The threat assessment shift (what changed in his nervous system):**
- Before: "We're married, we're open to it, natural timeline, no pressure."
- After: "We're married during a pandemic, and we just decided to be deliberate about conception. That makes it real in a different way. Intention changes the game."

**The wound this touched (his deepest fear it disproved):**
- Lie he believed: "If we start actively trying, she'll crack. The pressure will make her disappear into her mother's pattern."
- Proof: She says yes to deliberate timing. She shows up for it. She tracks her own cycle and tells him. She's more present, not less.

**The decision he made (the contract implicit in this moment):**
- "We shift from 'not preventing' to 'actively trying.' Deliberate but not obsessive."
- "Sex carries intention now. Every time might be the one. We're building toward the baby together."
- "Pack stays in our life through video, even if in-person is impossible."
- "I watch for her overwhelm pattern and interrupt it before it starts. She agreed to let me."
- "This is real now. We're trying for a baby during a pandemic. I hold that."

**How it lives in his body now (automatic patterns):**
- Tracks her cycle information (she shares it voluntarily, he holds it gently)
- Assumes sex carries conception intention (not pressure, but awareness)
- Checks in with her about overwhelm-pattern thoughts multiple times a week
- Maintains Pack connection through screens, assumes it'll return to in-person eventually
- Holds the "we're doing this during a pandemic" awareness without despair
- Uses sex as anchor and reconnection point through isolation

**The retrieval point (when activated, what does he remember?):**
- Lockdown starting so soon after the wedding
- The conversation about deliberate vs. natural timing, her saying yes
- Pack being distant but present through screens
- Her fear surfacing, him holding steadiness, her trusting him with that
- The strange temporality of "married and isolated and actively trying"
- His hands on her, sex carrying intention, the cycle information shared between them

## Current State Grid

**Sawyer:**
- **Physical state:** Home-based, routine-finding during lockdown, maintaining baseline activity
- **Emotional state:** Steady, tracking her state closely, holding intention about conception, managing Pack coordination
- **System activation level:** 5-6/10 (lockdown lower activation, intentional grounding, but aware of conception timing)
- **Arousal state:** Baseline maintained, timing-aware, not pressure-based
- **Grounding:** Her presence in isolation, routine sex as anchor + intention, Pack through screens, cycle information shared

**Elin:**
- **Physical state:** Home-based, adapting to isolation, cycle-aware
- **Emotional state:** Anxious about overwhelm pattern (her mother's), grateful for his steadiness, committed to deliberate timing
- **System activation level:** 5-6/10 (isolation settling, some anxiety threading, but manageable with his grounding)
- **Arousal state:** Responsive, intentional, grounded in sex as connection + conception-building
- **Grounding:** His presence, routine, Pack video calls, his check-ins about overwhelm

**Environmental:**
- **Primary locations:** Home (lockdown-bound)
- **Time of day/season:** April 13-19, 2020, early spring, full lockdown (~3 weeks in at start of week, ~4 weeks in by end)
- **Pippin:** Home, routine anchor
- **Pack presence:** Remote only (video calls, texts, phone), no in-person contact (lockdown rules)

## Active Threads

- **Married During Pandemic** — navigating newlywed life during lockdown
- **Deliberate Conception Begins** — shift from "not preventing" to "actively trying," cycle tracking, sexual contract operationalized
- **Sexual Contract: Every Time Carries Possibility** — named, intentional, explicit understanding between them
- **Conception Window Opens** — 6-month to 1-year realistic timeline begins
- **Pack Coordination Remote** — video calls instead of in-person weekends, infrastructure adapting
- **House Construction Adapted** — delays or restrictions due to COVID, timeline uncertain
- **Her Parental Overwhelm Fear** — activated by isolation, he holds steady and checks in regularly
- **Baseline Sex as Anchor** — intimacy as grounding through lockdown, now with intentional timing
- **Routine-Finding** — establishing what married + isolated + trying looks like

## Recent Canonical Beats

### **WEEK 214 (April 13-19, 2020):**
- **Early week:** Post-wedding settling continues, but lockdown momentum increasing (~3 weeks in)
- **Mid-week conversation:** Deliberate conception timing discussed and agreed
  - Her: "I'm ready to try deliberately. I want this intentional."
  - Him: "We can do that. It changes things, makes it real."
  - Agreement: Cycle tracking, timing awareness, sex as intention
  - Explicit understanding: "Every time carries possibility now."
- **Throughout week:**
  - Sex carries timing awareness (but no obsession, no performance)
  - Her cycle information shared between them
  - His check-ins about overwhelm pattern (daily or multiple times a week)
  - Pack video calls continuing (scheduled connection)
  - House planning continuing remotely (delayed by COVID)
  - Isolation settling into new normal
- **End of week:** First month of deliberate timing beginning, first full cycle tracked

## Sensory Anchors Hot This Period

- **Lockdown silence:** Strange quiet to get used to, both of them home constantly
- **Home as full-time space:** No field work, no office, just them and Pippin
- **Video call screens:** Pack faces pixelated but present, connection maintained
- **Routine sex:** Anchor through unpredictability, now with timing awareness
- **Her cycle information:** Shared vulnerability, trust in his handling of data
- **Her hand finding his:** Checking that he's there, steadiness present
- **Overwhelm-pattern check-ins:** Him naming the fear before it spirals, her leaning into his grounding
- **Deliberate timing conversation:** The moment they decided to shift intention
- **Ring visible:** Married status, present on both their hands

---

## Inner Child Parts Active

- **His:** Protective parts activated, holding her emotional state, younger parts engaged in family-building intention, Fifteen present in caretaking
- **Hers:** Anxious parts surfacing (mother's overwhelm pattern), younger self needing reassurance that she won't disappear, parts committed to baby-building

---

## Ongoing Developments & Hooks

- **Weeks 215-251:** "Deliberately trying" continues through lockdown, 8-month period with no pregnancy (eventual ~10 more months of waiting)
- **Week 252:** Pregnancy confirmation (late Dec 2020)
- **House construction timeline:** Shifting due to COVID delays, uncertainty ongoing
- **Pack coordination:** Adapting to sustained remote contact, in-person gradually opening as summer approaches
- **Her anxiety trajectory:** Will it worsen? Will routine hold? Will his check-ins prevent overwhelm spiral?
- **Sexual timing:** How does deliberate timing feel over months? Does it become routine or stay intentional?

---

## What He's Tracking (Sawyer's Internal Focus)

- Her emotional state through lockdown isolation
- Whether panic/overwhelm pattern activates or holds
- Pack connection sustaining through distance
- House construction impact (delays? budget implications?)
- Time passing with deliberate timing but no pregnancy (awareness, no pressure, but aware)
- Cycle information and timing windows
- Her response to deliberate timing (is she okay with it? does it feel sustainable?)
- When Pack can return to in-person gathering

---

## What's Not Yet Known

- How long lockdown will last / impact on their life
- House construction timeline (how delayed?)
- How her anxiety trajectory evolves through pandemic
- How deliberate timing feels after 1-2-3 months (routine vs. intentional?)
- Pregnancy outcome (Week 252 — eventual confirmation after many cycles)
- Whether they shift approach if conception takes longer than expected
- COVID long-term impact on Pack coordination, house timeline, family planning
