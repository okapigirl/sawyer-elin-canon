# WEEK 214 — Post-Wedding, Early COVID, Still Not Preventing

**Date Range:** April 13-19, 2020  
**Gap Since Last Scene:** 6 weeks (Week 207 wedding; Weeks 208-213 post-wedding integration, early COVID lockdown began mid-March)  
**Current Life Phase:** Married baseline settling, early COVID isolation, still in "not preventing" mode, house construction adapting to restrictions

## What He Tells People (Social Version)

"Got married at the end of February. Then COVID lockdown happened basically immediately after. Now we're figuring out what married and isolated looks like."

*[Why this version: True but surface. Doesn't mention conception timing, Pack coordination, house delays, the emotional weight of starting this phase during a pandemic.]*

---

## What He Actually Thinks About (Private Version)

Married for 6 weeks and then the world locked down. They've been "not preventing" since October (6 months now), natural timeline still playing out—no pregnancy yet, no active trying framework established. Just living, being intimate as normal, open to it happening whenever.

COVID complicates everything: Pack can't be in person, house construction is delayed or adapted, and he's tracking her emotional state more carefully through lockdown stress. She's worried about slipping into her mother's overwhelm pattern. He's watching to make sure she doesn't disappear.

Still not pregnant. Not actively trying. Just aware that it could happen whenever, and knowing that if it doesn't happen in the next 4-5 months they might need to think about it differently—but canon doesn't specify what that thinking looks like yet.

## Core Memory Architecture (For Future Writing)

**The sensory flash (what he feels without thinking):**
- Married 6 weeks when lockdown hits
- Sex continues as baseline, not timed or tracked
- Her checking in with herself (parental overwhelm fear) daily
- Pack distant, video calls only
- House construction paused or heavily restricted
- The strangeness of "everything is locked down and we're newly married"

**The threat assessment shift (what changed in his nervous system):**
- Before: "We're married, we're open to it, natural timeline."
- After: "We're married during a pandemic, and conception hasn't happened yet. Not tracking, not pushing, just living. But aware that time is passing."

**The wound this touched (his deepest fear it disproved):**
- TBD (canon not yet established for this period)

**The decision he made (the contract implicit in this moment):**
- "We stay 'not preventing,' don't shift to active trying yet unless something changes."
- "We weather the pandemic without losing the foundation we built."
- "Pack stays in our life through video, even if in-person is impossible."

**How it lives in his body now (automatic patterns):**
- Tracks her emotional state more carefully through lockdown isolation
- Maintains sex as baseline despite circumstances
- Handles Pack coordination remotely
- Holds the "we're open to it happening" awareness without pressure

**The retrieval point (when activated, what does he remember?):**
- Lockdown starting so soon after the wedding
- Pack being distant but present through screens
- Her fear surfacing, him holding steadiness
- The strange temporality of "married and isolated and waiting"

## Current State Grid

**Sawyer:**
- **Physical state:** Home-based, routine-finding during lockdown
- **Emotional state:** Steady, tracking her state closely, managing Pack coordination
- **System activation level:** 5-6/10 (lockdown lower activation, intentional grounding)
- **Arousal state:** Baseline maintained, not pressure-based
- **Grounding:** Her presence in isolation, routine sex as anchor, Pack through screens

**Elin:**
- **Physical state:** Home-based, adapting to isolation
- **Emotional state:** Anxious about overwhelm pattern (her mother's), grateful for his steadiness
- **System activation level:** 5-6/10 (isolation settling, some anxiety threading)
- **Arousal state:** Responsive, grounded in sex as connection
- **Grounding:** His presence, routine, Pack video calls

**Environmental:**
- **Primary locations:** Home (lockdown-bound)
- **Time of day/season:** April 2020, early spring, full lockdown in effect (~3 weeks in)
- **Pippin:** Home, routine anchor
- **Pack presence:** Remote only (video calls, texts, phone)

## Active Threads

- **Married During Pandemic** — navigating newlywed life during lockdown
- **Not Preventing (Still)** — 6 months in, no pregnancy yet, no active trying framework established
- **Pack Coordination Remote** — video calls instead of in-person weekends
- **House Construction Adapted** — delays or restrictions due to COVID
- **Her Parental Overwhelm Fear** — activated by isolation, he holds steady
- **Baseline Sex as Anchor** — intimacy as grounding through lockdown, not performance or timing
- **Routine-Finding** — establishing what married + isolated looks like

## Recent Canonical Beats

- Week 207 (Feb 29): Wedding happened, still not pregnant
- Weeks 208-213: Post-wedding integration (~6 weeks), COVID lockdown began mid-March
- Week 214 (mid-April): 6 weeks married, 3+ weeks into lockdown, 6 months of not preventing with no pregnancy yet

---

## Sensory Anchors Hot This Period

- **Lockdown silence:** Strange quiet to get used to
- **Home as full-time space:** No field work, no office, just them
- **Video call screens:** Pack faces pixelated but present
- **Routine sex:** Anchor through unpredictability
- **Her hand finding his:** Checking that he's there, steadiness present

---

## Inner Child Parts Active

- **His:** Protective parts activated, holding her emotional state
- **Hers:** Anxious parts surfacing (mother's overwhelm pattern), younger self needing reassurance that she won't disappear

---

## Ongoing Developments & Hooks

- Weeks 214-245: "Not preventing" continues through lockdown, no pregnancy (eventual ~10 more months of waiting)
- House construction timeline shifting due to COVID delays
- Pack coordination adapting to sustained remote contact
- Her anxiety managing (will it worsen? will routine hold?)

---

## What He's Tracking (Sawyer's Internal Focus)

- Her emotional state through lockdown isolation
- Whether panic/overwhelm pattern activates or holds
- Pack connection sustaining through distance
- House construction impact (delays? budget?)
- Time passing with no pregnancy (awareness but not pressure)

---

## What's Not Yet Known

- How long lockdown will last / impact on their life
- Whether they shift to more deliberate conception attempts later
- House construction timeline (how delayed?)
- How her anxiety trajectory evolves
- Pregnancy outcome (Week 245-248)
