## Current State (Week 190 Morning)
**Location:** Their apartment (temporary)  
**Relationship Status:** Engaged (legally marrying 4-6 months), actively trying to conceive (starting immediately, realistic 6mo-1yr window)  
**Pack Status:** Quad locked in (Sawyer, Elin, Madeline, Sadie); structural support formalized  
**Major Projects Active:**
- House architect (Ben) meeting tonight (7pm) to review phased construction plans
- Wedding planning (4-6 month timeline, legal marriage first)
- Conception tracking (every sexual encounter carries possibility, intentional)
- Pack spreadsheet logistics (Sadie's overnight doc, color-coded priorities)

## Core Contracts (Foundational)
- **Career Support:** Field work = yes by default; "never say no to what lights you up"
- **Sexual Frequency:** Post-separation spike = baseline; location-freedom expanding
- **Reciprocity:** Response-based arousal valid; performance = hard boundary
- **Blowjob Boundary:** Never forced; sensory autonomy honored; anxiety = not personal failure
- **Saliva Boundary:** Non-negotiable from first kiss (honored + reframed Week 36-37)
- **Reciprosexuality + Demisexuality:** Named + validated as baseline wiring
- **Command Mode (Trauma-Precision):** Emerges when explicitly requested; somatic retraining framework
- **Inner Child Parts:** Four, Seven, Fifteen (Sawyer); Baby/Three-Four, Seven/Eight, Fourteen, Seventeen (Elin)—all integrated + named publicly (Week 36-37)
- **Pack Structural Support:** Sadie (logistics/spreadsheet), Madeline (emotional overflow); signal = presence guarantee
- **Every Sexual Encounter:** Carries conception possibility (Week 190 forward)
- **Wedding + Kid Timeline:** Legal marriage 4-6 months; stop being careful now; realistic 6mo-1yr conception

## Active Threads (Top Priority)
1. **Architect Meeting Tonight (7pm):** Ben reviewing house designs; wedding date + location finalization locked after this meeting
2. **Pack Spreadsheet:** Foundation Support Structure tabs under review; Financial Planning + Contingency waiting for architect input
3. **Parental Trauma Resurfaces:** Her fear of disappearing into motherhood like her mother did; his fierce counter-narrative present + ongoing
4. **Location Scouting:** Rural-accessible model (Sadie & Madeline's as template); 2-hour airport access, water, woodlands + meadow, other kids accessible
5. **Sexual Contract Shift:** Every time from here = possibility; both committed; feral-claimed Week 189 night

## Hard Rules
- **Saliva:** Never pushed beyond boundary; no exceptions
- **Jaw:** Consent boundary tested + held; intimacy + vulnerability on both sides
- **Blowjob Anxiety:** Witnessed but not resolved; deeper processing required; never pressure
- **Mask-Calling:** Sharp truth preferred to soft accommodation (his baseline during family contact + activated states)
- **Inner Parts Public:** Once named (Week 36-37), can be referenced in conversation; Fifteen's wounds held by Pack
- **Pack Presence:** Remote coordination = essential; video calls formalized; Sadie's signal guarantee non-negotiable
- **Therapy:** From birth = non-negotiable for future kid
- **Nervous System First:** Childcare + parenting philosophy based on responsive regulation, not dogma

## Nicknames & Relational Modes
- **Maisie** = his exclusive anchored name for her (vulnerability, tenderness)
- **Maze** = his teasing/casual name (playful, feral-joy)
- **Soot** = her exclusive name for him (post-trauma-release, feral + intimate + reverent)
- **Command Mode** = his somatic-precision state (sharp, no-patience, mask-calling); distinct from regular dominance
- **Cryptid Sex** = feral, grounded outdoor sex post-family-activation

## Sensory Anchors
- **Forehead-to-Forehead:** Reset button (regulation + intimacy)
- **Hair-Grip:** Grounding + arousal fusion (she in his hair, him in control)
- **Back-of-Head Touch:** Trauma-reclaimed (she made it feel safe again)
- **Hand on Sternum:** Physical trauma release anchor (parental wound)
- **Palm Pressure Grounding:** Sustained pressure on stomach/shoulder blades = nervous system regulation (established Week 29 family contact)
- **Bathrobe Belt:** First restraint texture (her leading phase, Week 8)
- **Breast Stimulation:** Context-dependent (discovered during her leading phase, arousal anchor)
- **Wall Sex:** First non-traditional location (reclamation, intensity without buildup)
- **Full-Contact Sleep:** Chest-to-chest, synchronized breathing = default position
- **Sandalwood + Leather-Tobacco:** His scents = her nervous system anchors
- **Camomile Tea:** First tea they shared together; portable tether during activated states

## Verbal Triggers
- **"Good Girl" / "Good Fucking Girl":** Tactical deployment; she combusts (genuine response, not performance)
- **"You're Exactly My Speed":** Nervous system match recognition
- **"You're Safe Now":** Reparenting affirmation (his inner parts)
- **"You're Yours. And I'm Mine. And We Choose Each Other.":** Post-trauma grounding
- **"I Am Feral. I Am Soot.":** Mode self-claiming
- **"Not Not-Now":** Kid timeline phrasing (will happen, safe to not-rush)
- **"Every Time From Here On Out Carries Possibility":** Sexual contract shift naming
- **Countdown Timer (Odd Numbers):** Precision math arousal trigger (17 minutes, 4 minutes and 11 seconds, 90-second timer)
- **"Fuck Your Smile":** Mask interrupt (sharp, not mean)
- **"You feel how much power's buried in your fucking chest":** Tangled thread naming
- **"That pain is not who you are":** Somatic trauma reframing
- **Green Day's *Redundant*:** Music + verbal trigger (I love you's not enough)

## Physical Descriptors
- **Sawyer:** Tall (stooped sometimes), field-work lean, zoologist-precision, chaotic brain engaged, Fifteen protective, Four-year-old hidden, Seven-year-old escape-artist wiring, all integrated (Week 8+)
- **Elin:** Illustrator hands, autistic processing, younger parts (Baby, Seven/Eight, Fourteen, Seventeen), core identity = creator, wiring matches his across multiple axes (crushes, sensory, special interests, values)

## Pack Configuration
- **Sadie:** Toph Beifong energy, spreadsheet-love-language, logistics-keeper, "you'll never get radio silence—you'll always get signal"
- **Madeline:** Emotional overflow, combustion mode, co-regulation with Elin (Week 36-37), joy + presence
- **Quad Consent:** Emotional + logistical + act-based; "no filters" clause active; reciprosexuality + demisexuality shared baseline; Sawyer's consent-rooted dominance ("pick the one that makes you feel like you already won, I'll handle the consequences")

## Memory Hooks (Canonical Beats)
- **Bookstore Meet:** Wet-dog entrance, "you're exactly my speed," first coffee
- **Rain Walk:** Saliva boundary named + honored from first kiss
- **Couch Mapping:** "Good girl" discovery, systemic interdependence named, feedback loop established
- **Hawaii Separation:** Text updates = nervous system anchor; separation survives = "bad partner" wound further countered
- **Hawaii Reunion:** Inner child work (Four, Seven, Fifteen), post-trauma-release confidence, Soot emergence, future family recognition ("our son just fell asleep"), wildlife metaphor locked in
- **Family Birthday Planning (Week 29):** Cryptid sex coined, family activation language formalized, creative documentation named
- **First Family Meeting (Week 31):** Elin's full disclosure (autism, burn-out, publishing career), Caroline's deficit-framing countered, Tom's interest emerges (Efteling connection), Fifteen's photo located in hallway, chamomile callback
- **Wedding Weekend (Week 36-37):** Quad formation locked in, inner parts public naming, Madeline-Elin co-regulation breakthrough, Sadie's witnessing + authority claimed
- **Architect Week (Week 190):** Both committed to "now," wedding 4-6 months, kid timeline stop-being-careful-NOW, Pack spreadsheet operationalized, every sexual encounter = possibility

## Timeline Logic
- **Week 8 (April 2016):** Foundation setting (all inner child work, emotional reclamation, future family recognition, timezone experimental intimacy)
- **Week 29-31 (Sept-Dec 2016):** Family integration (her parents meet him, his family faces her, both survive)
- **Week 36-37 (Nov 2016):** Pack expansion (Madeline + Sadie actively enter erotic/emotional dynamic, quad formation confirmed)
- **Week 190 (Sept 2020):** Future-locking (architect plans, wedding date, conception intentional start, Pack support structure formalized)
- **Week 200 (Feb 29, 2020):** Wedding [LEAP DAY]
- **Week 207 (Late Feb 2020):** Wedding execution
- **Week 214 (April 2020):** Early COVID, conception actively tracking
- **Week 245-248 (Dec 2020):** Pregnancy confirmed
- **Week 275-280 (Aug 23, 2021):** Birth
