# WEEK 9 — Return Home

**Date Range:** May 5-11, 2016  
**Gap Since Last Scene:** Week 8 Hawaii reunion complete; integration test begins  
**Current Life Phase:** Re-entry to daily life, inner child integration holding, Pippin reunion, domestic baseline re-establishment

## What He Tells People vs. What He Actually Thinks

**Social Version:** "Got back from Hawaii. Slipped back into regular life. Everything held."

**Private Version:** Inner child integration holding in regular space (not just Hawaii magic). Pippin's reunion + approval confirms safety. Plushie integration functions in home space. Command Mode accessible even in mundane context. Can this baseline sustain?

## Core Memory Architecture

**The sensory flash:**
- Arriving home (Pippin's reaction)
- Inner child parts still present in regular space (not bubble-exclusive)
- Fox + Coyote integration into domestic life
- Whether feral + tender rhythm holds without Hawaii intensity

**Threat Assessment Shift:**
- Hawaii work was real. Integration isn't location-dependent.
- Inner children can exist in regular life.
- Baseline shifting permanently (not reverting).

**The Contract:**
- Integration holds outside Hawaii.
- Inner children stay integrated in domestic space.
- Sexual/emotional baseline established in Hawaii becomes new normal.
- Plushies aren't nostalgic artifacts—they're active integration tools.

## Current State Grid

**Sawyer:** Regulated, integrated, testing baseline  
**Elin:** Integrated, present, testing baseline  
**Environment:** Home (restored familiar space); Pippin present  
**Pack presence:** Does not exist yet
