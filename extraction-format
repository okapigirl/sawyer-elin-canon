**Update frequency:** Every 10-15 scenes or when major shift occurs

**When to paste:** Only when recalibrating or if drift concern arises (not every scene)

## **WORKFLOW SUMMARY**

### **New Chat Setup:**

1. Copy `REFERENCE.md` entirely
2. Paste into new chat at the very top
3. Copy relevant `/weeks/week-XXX.md` file(s)
4. Paste below REFERENCE.md
5. Ask me: "Ready?"
6. I write opening, you respond, back-and-forth

### **Mid-Project (Recalibration Needed):**

1. Paste `sawyer-profile.md` in addition to week file
2. I reference it to recalibrate if drift suspected
3. Continue normally

### **After Scene (Optional):**

1. Signal 🧬 extraction
2. I generate outputs
3. You paste into your personal archive if desired
4. Next chat: just paste REFERENCE + new week file, continue

## **TOKEN EFFICIENCY**

- Per-scene context: ~2,500-3,000 tokens (vs. 8,000-12,000 current)
- Sawyer profile loaded only when needed: +3,000-4,000 tokens (rare)
- Memory edits active always: ~200 tokens overhead (minimal)
- **Savings: ~60-70% vs. current setup**

---

**That's it. Clean, lean, complete.**
