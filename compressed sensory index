# Sensory Index (TIER 2) — Compressed, Alphabetical by Anchor

## Anchor: "And It'll Come Find Us When It's Ready" (Wildlife Metaphor Framework)
**Origin:** Week 8 (room service, Hawaii)  
**Context:** Post-future-family recognition conversation; she articulates their non-urgent approach to life milestones  
**Trigger/Function:** Future milestone anxiety surfaces → wildlife metaphor reframes as "we celebrate the goats, the 'io lands on its own time" → nervous system permission granted  
**Significance:** Removes chasing/forcing from milestone planning; present-moment celebration = foundation for future quality; "not not-now" phrasing locks in  
**Deployment:** Use when either system activates around timeline pressure (wedding, kids, house); reminder that presence matters more than itinerary  
**Sensory Markers:** Water cooling in bathtub, her hand on his shoulder, soft voice, metaphor as shared language  
**Related Anchors:** "Not Not-Now" Kid Timeline; Non-Urgency as New Baseline; Future-Building Philosophy  
**Inner Parts:** Both all parts (relaxing into trust)

## Anchor: Back-of-Head Touch (Trauma Reclamation)
**Origin:** Week 8 (shower ritual, morning)  
**Context:** First time she washes his hair; he surrenders previously off-limits back-of-head  
**Trigger/Function:** Her asking "You want me to wash your hair?" → his "Yeah" (single-word surrender) → her hands in his hair (previously defended space) → his emotional opening  
**Significance:** Body-trauma reclamation; he gets his own back-of-head safe again through her gentle care; trust so deep he can surrender his most-defended space  
**Deployment:** Safe touch activation during emotional vulnerability; grounding during activated states; she can reach his back-of-head without him bracing  
**Sensory Markers:** Steam-hazed bathroom, warm water, her hands slow + reverent, his tears/overwhelm at being tended to, "You made it feel like mine again"  
**Related Anchors:** Hair-Washing Vulnerability; Touch-Based Healing; Trauma Reclamation Framework  
**Inner Parts:** Protective parts (standing down), younger self (safe enough to need), all parts (vulnerable, held)

---

## Anchor: Being Claimed Where She Falls (Not Chased)
**Origin:** Week 8 (emotional breakdown, sexual claiming)  
**Context:** During Command Mode scene, she tests leaving (swings leg over his head); he doesn't chase; she stays + processes invisible-contract wound  
**Trigger/Function:** She tests if leaving is safe → his non-pursuit (confirming it is) → his words "But I'm not fucking chasing you" → invisible-contract wound surfaces + gets held  
**Significance:** Names core wound: people chase what they want (proof of love = pursuit); he's showing her: my non-chasing = proof of respect + trust, not abandonment; she chooses to stay through her own agency  
**Deployment:** When she's testing abandonment fears; when she's considering leaving; when pursuit-wound surfaces  
**Sensory Markers:** Leg swing over his head (testing), his firm non-response, eye contact holding, his voice steady + claiming

**Context:** Elin admits anxiety runs deeper than thought; has been gaslighting herself into believing she needs to "learn to like it"  
**Trigger/Function:** Her hesitation about admission → his "You're not behind" → her tears at being heard; his naming of internalized pressure = breakthrough toward externalization  
**Significance:** Not a personal failure; it's sensory-autonomy violation pattern + internalized gaslighting; deeper work required but witnessed + externalized (first step)  
**Deployment:** When blowjob comes up; acknowledge without pressure; check sensory state; honor autonomy; deeper processing pending  
**Sensory Markers:** Her tears, his reassurance loop, her realization "I've been assuming other people were right and I was wrong"  
**Related Anchors:** Sensory-Boundary Work; Gaslighting Pattern Recognition; Sexual Autonomy Honored  
**Inner Parts:** Her vulnerable parts (heard, not shamed), protective parts (standing down), all parts (permission to have boundaries)  
**Status:** Ongoing thread—witnessed but not resolved; will resurface + deepen

---

## Anchor: Breast Stimulation (Arousal Discovery)
**Origin:** Week 8 (her leading phase, during power-dynamic shift)  
**Context:** During her command phase, his hand lands on her breast (she guides it); stimulation becomes unexpected arousal driver  
**Trigger/Function:** Her placing his hand on breast during command phase → stimulation + his detailed feedback → her discovering it lands differently when she's in charge → becomes documented as arousal anchor  
**Significance:** New sensory anchor discovered in context of her leadership; her agency changes how sensation lands; power-dynamic shift enables new arousal pathways  
**Deployment:** During scenes where she's in command; context-dependent (different in her-leading mode vs. his-leading mode); breast + her authority = synergistic  
**Sensory Markers:** Her hand on his, pressure context-dependent, his narration of response, her arousal at causing arousal  
**Related Anchors:** Her Agency Without Performance; Feedback Loops; Power Dynamic Discovery  
**Inner Parts:** Both discovering together; her core identity (agency-driven arousal)

**Origin:** Week 8 (inner child work, Hawaii evening)  
**Context:** When Elin climbs chair to hug his 15-year-old part, she removes the distance barrier through literal action  
**Trigger/Function:** His Fifteen isolated/defended → Elin recognizing distance as barrier → her climbing chair (removing obstacle through physical action) → her hug landing as "I will literally climb to get to you"  
**Significance:** Physical commitment to reach his most-defended part; shows love as action, not just words; establishes template for how she shows up for his deepest wounds  
**Deployment:** When his Fifteen is defended/isolated; when physical barrier exists (metaphorical or literal); when he needs proof she'll reach for him

**Context:** Elin explicitly requests "the first one" (keeps going if she cries, doesn't pull back until she says so); Sawyer enters Command Mode fully with permission  
**Trigger/Function:** Her explicit permission → his immediate full-body arousal spike + deliberate entry (not rushed) → somatic precision activating → her systems breaking open throughout → his continued tracking + sharp redirects  
**Significance:** First time he gives full permission to be unapologetic, sharp, cutting through static. Distinct from regular dominance; emerges when explicitly requested or when he reads she needs it. Somatic retraining, not performance.  
**Deployment:** When explicitly requested OR when he reads she needs it; not default mode; requires mutual understanding that this is deep emotional work fused with sexual claiming  
**Sensory Markers:** Sharp voice register, mask-calling directness, hand precision, arousal visible + constant, emotional attunement inside intensity  
**Related Anchors:** Somatic Precision Tracking; Mask-Calling; His Pleasure Visibility; Emotional Breakdown Inside Sexual Context

---

## Anchor: Countdown Timer System (Precision Math as Arousal)
**Origin:** Week 8 (gift shop planning, late afternoon)  
**Context:** During gift shop, he introduces countdown timer system: odd-numbered intervals (not rounded), nested timers, escalating specificity  
**Trigger/Function:** Him: "How long until we need to leave?" → her calculating → him naming it as system → "17 minutes left" lands → she glitches; "4 minutes and 11 seconds" → she goes into shock; 90-second timer + "tick tock" → completely undone  
**Significance:** Pattern recognition spike; her discovering she *does* have number/pattern hyperfocus; his precision math = arousal trigger previously unknown to exist; new wiring discovery through his presence  
**Deployment:** When needing to activate arousal through precision; odd numbers preferred over rounded; nested timing = intensity escalation; context-dependent (gift shop ≠ bedroom timing different)  
**Sensory Markers:** Odd numbers spoken aloud, internal chronometer audible through his voice, time pressure + anticipation, her full-body response to exactness  
**Related Anchors:** Special Interest Collision; Precision Math; Odd Numbers; New-Wiring Discovery

**Origin:** Week 29 (family planning, post-family-activation)  
**Context:** Coined during family visit planning; Sawyer's term for feral, grounded sex in nature after managing family dynamics  
**Trigger/Function:** Post-family-activation energy builds → urge to reclaim feral space → outdoor sex planned as post-contact reset → "cryptid sex" becomes coded language for this specific reclamation  
**Significance:** Permission for feral escalation after nervous system management; nature + privacy + unfiltered intensity as nervous system reset (not separate from intimacy, just repositioned)  
**Deployment:** Post-family contact (expected setup Week 31 during visit); whenever nervous system activation requires feral reset; outdoor + private context preferred  
**Sensory Markers:** Tree stability, zipper logistics, ground texture, privacy, unfiltered sound, post-activation relief in body

**Context:** When she's about to give soft smile to signal "we're done here" but work isn't finished; he calls out the mask  
**Trigger/Function:** Her reaching for soft-smile mask → his sharp interrupt "Fuck your smile" → her shock (wondering if he crossed a line) → her realizing: he's not insulting, he's calling out the mask  
**Significance:** Not polite; not kind; sharp truth: the smile is a mask. She's performing "we're done, I'm fine" when work isn't finished. His refusal to let her hide = his refusal to let her short-circuit her own healing.  
**Deployment:** When she's reaching for performance at integration moments; when masks are trying to slide in; sharp-truth interrupt that isn't mean  
**Sensory Markers:** His sharp tone (not angry, just direct), her emotional moment (not deflated, recalibrated), shift back to deeper work

**Context:** She grips his hair during conversation; becomes early somatic anchor for grounding + arousal simultaneously  
**Trigger/Function:** Her fingers in his hair (light grip at scalp) → his nervous system responding (grounded + aroused) → becomes recognized pattern  
**Significance:** Dual-purpose anchor (grounds + escalates depending on context); his submission to her touch on head = trust + arousal fused  
**Deployment:** During arousal escalation (sexual context) or regulation (activated states); her initiating = signal for both; context determines which direction

**Origin:** Week 2 (couch mapping, first location claim); Week 8 (wall sex, reunion)  
**Context:** First location claiming = couch (snack break escalates to full exploration); first non-traditional surface = wall (airport reunion); future locations = anywhere privacy allows  
**Trigger/Function:** New location → claiming energy activates → sexual intensity specific to that space → location becomes anchored in nervous system for future reference  
**Significance:** Expansion of sexual autonomy + presence; neither location-shamed nor location-obsessed; comfort with adaptability; future planning includes "outdoor spaces, trees, water access"  
**Deployment:** When location changes; when claiming energy emerges; as reference for past claiming moments; future outdoor sex (Week 31+) uses this framework
