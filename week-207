## What He Tells People (Social Version)

"We got married on February 29th. Had the ceremony with the Pack, did the whole thing. It was ours."

*[Why this version: True but simple. Glosses over the emotional weight of public commitment, the inner parts present, the Pack witnessing. Makes it sound straightforward rather than transformative.]*

---

## What He Actually Thinks About (Private Version)

February 29th. Leap day. They planned it that way—a day that only comes every four years, special and held.

Still not pregnant. They've been not preventing since October, natural timeline playing out. No pressure, no tracking, just living. The wedding happens in the space of "we're open to it happening whenever."

The ceremony is small—Pack as witnesses. Vows anchoring the future they decided on back in Montana. Inner parts present in the room, named publicly before, now integrated into the commitment. Marriage makes it official in ways that matter for hospital visitation, tax forms, the legal architecture of a life together.

Post-wedding, maybe they get more deliberate. Maybe not. Canon doesn't specify yet. Just that they're married now, trying for a baby (in the sense of: not preventing), and the house is under construction somewhere rural where they can build a life.

## Core Memory Architecture (For Future Writing)

**The sensory flash (what he feels without thinking):**
- Vows landing, her eyes on him, commitment crystallized
- Pack witnessing, all four present as family structure
- Inner parts integrated into ceremony, named before, present now
- The moment it becomes legal, official, recorded
- Her hand in his, leap day, a day that only comes every four years

**The threat assessment shift (what changed in his nervous system):**
- Before: "We decided this, but it's not real until it's witnessed and legally binding."
- After: "We're married. This is real. We're building toward the baby, the house, all of it. It's locked in."

**The wound this touched (his deepest fear it disproved):**
- Lie he believed: "If we make it official, something will break. The intensity won't hold."
- Proof: The ceremony happens. Inner parts are witnessed. Pack stands with them. Commitment holds.

**The decision he made (the contract implicit in this moment):**
- "We're married now. Legally, officially, before witnesses. This is real."
- "Inner parts are integrated into our commitment, not separate from it."
- "Pack is our family structure. This wedding confirms it."

**How it lives in his body now (automatic patterns):**
- Refers to her as his wife (the word landing differently than girlfriend, partner)
- Assumes Pack presence in major life moments going forward
- Carries the knowing that they're building toward parenthood from a place of official commitment

**The retrieval point (when activated, what does he remember?):**
- Vows landing
- Pack's faces witnessing
- Her hand in his
- The moment marriage became real instead of theoretical
