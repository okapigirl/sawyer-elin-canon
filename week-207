# WEEK 207 — SAWYER & ELIN'S WEDDING

**Date Range:** February 24-29, 2020  
**Gap Since Last Scene:** 1 week (Weeks 201-206 final preparation + choreography sessions; wedding week arrival)  
**Current Life Phase:** Wedding ceremony + immediate aftermath, Pack celebration, legal marriage formalized, conception cycles 5-6 in window (still no pregnancy)

## What He Tells People (Social Version)

"We got married on February 29th. Had the ceremony with the Pack, did the whole thing. It was ours."

*[Why this version: True but simple. Glosses over the emotional weight of public commitment, the inner parts present, the Pack witnessing. Makes it sound straightforward rather than transformative. Doesn't mention choreography success, Rachel's photography, still-not-pregnant awareness threading underneath.]*

## What He Actually Thinks About (Private Version)

February 29th. Leap day. They planned it that way—a day that only comes every four years, special and held.

Still not pregnant. They've been at this since October (five months now), no tracking, just living and open. The wedding happens in the space of "we're open to it happening whenever." Post-wedding, maybe they get more deliberate about timing. Canon doesn't specify yet.

The ceremony is small—Pack as witnesses. Vows anchoring the future they decided on back in Montana. Inner parts present in the room, named publicly before, now integrated into the commitment. Marriage makes it official in ways that matter for hospital visitation, tax forms, the legal architecture of a life together.

The first dance is the choreographed rock and roll routine. Two weeks of Madeline teaching them, him learning the lead, her finding the follow, their bodies remembering movement together. When the music starts and his hands find her hips, when she trusts his lead completely, when he pulls her into the dip—it lands as everything. Movement they built together with the Pack, executed in front of everyone, their commitment in motion.

Rachel's there with her camera, capturing it all. The ceremony, the dance, the four of them in photos. The wedding album will have dozens of shots—them coming down the aisle, vows, the dance, Pack's faces witnessing.

## Core Memory Architecture (For Future Writing)

**The sensory flash (what he feels without thinking):**
- Vows landing, her eyes on him, commitment crystallized
- Pack witnessing, all four present as family structure
- Inner parts integrated into ceremony, named before, present now
- The moment it becomes legal, official, recorded
- Her hand in his, leap day, a day that only comes every four years
- The first dance: his hands on her hips, her trusting his lead, the dip catching her completely
- Rachel's camera capturing everything, the album they'll have forever
- Her giddy in the dress, him in formal wear, both of them shaking slightly during vows

**The threat assessment shift (what changed in his nervous system):**
- Before: "We decided this, but it's not real until it's witnessed and legally binding."
- After: "We're married. This is real. The dance held. Pack witnessed. The album exists. It's locked in."

**The wound this touched (his deepest fear it disproved):**
- Lie he believed: "If we make it official, something will break. The intensity won't hold. Public commitment means losing her."
- Proof: The ceremony happens. Inner parts are witnessed. Pack stands with them. The dance is perfect. Commitment holds. She's more his, not less.

**The decision he made (the contract implicit in this moment):**
- "We're married now. Legally, officially, before witnesses. This is real."
- "Inner parts are integrated into our commitment, not separate from it."
- "Pack is our family structure. This wedding confirms it."
- "The choreographed first dance is locked in canon now—that's what we did."
- "Post-wedding, we shift to more deliberate conception attempts (canon TBD but assumption is yes)."

**How it lives in his body now (automatic patterns):**
- Refers to her as his wife (the word landing differently than girlfriend, partner)
- Assumes Pack presence in major life moments going forward
- Carries the knowing that they're building toward parenthood from a place of official commitment
- The first dance is retrievable—not a performance, but a choice they made together with the Pack's help
- Rachel's photos are *their* wedding album, not someone else's documentation

**The retrieval point (when activated, what does he remember?):**
- Vows landing
- Pack's faces witnessing
- Her hand in his during the dance
- The dip—catching her, her trusting completely
- The moment marriage became real instead of theoretical
- Rachel's camera clicking, the album being created in real-time
