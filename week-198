## What He Tells People (Social Version)

"She had her bachelorette day. They did a dance class, photos, cocktails. Pack kept her out all day. She came home wrecked in the best way."

*[Why this version: True but surface. Doesn't mention the lipgloss trigger, the eight hours of him waiting and being managed by Sadie's photos, Rachel the photographer being hired mid-shoot, the choreography decision that landed as important. Makes it sound like standard bachelorette when it was actually structural.]*

## What He Actually Thinks About (Private Version)

She leaves at 10 AM and doesn't come home until 8:30 PM. Eight hours. He's been half-hard since Sadie sent the first photo from the dance class—her in that cherry-print dress, moving, loose—and fully gone since the photoshoot images started arriving. Sadie, doing what Sadie does: strategic torture. Photos just enough to keep him wrecked, not enough to satisfy.

By the time she walks through the door, he's been sitting on the couch thinking about her for eight hours. The lipgloss photos hit him hardest—the shine, the texture, the knowledge of exactly what it does to him when her mouth is on his. She knew. She deliberately put it on before they left, knowing he wouldn't see it until the photos arrived.

But the bigger thing: the first dance. She mentions it casual in the car back—"Madeline knows a routine, rock and roll, simple but looks good, ends with a dip, thought maybe we could try it?" And something in him locks into place. A choreographed first dance. Movement they both know, built together with the Pack. It lands as important in a way he didn't expect, important enough that he wants it locked in immediately.

Still not pregnant. They've been at this since October (five months now). No active tracking, no pressure, just living and being open to it. If it doesn't happen soon they'll probably shift to more deliberate timing, but canon doesn't specify that yet.

## Core Memory Architecture (For Future Writing)

**The sensory flash (what he feels without thinking):**
- Eight hours of waiting, managed by Sadie's strategic photo releases
- Lipgloss shine hitting him in photos, immediate feral response
- The moment she mentions choreography, something crystallizes
- Her walking through the door, him catching her immediately
- Pack watching from the hallway end, Madeline filming
- The choreography decision landing as "this matters, we're doing this"

**The threat assessment shift (what changed in his nervous system):**
- Before: "Standard bachelorette day, she'll be out, I'll manage the waiting."
- After: "She just spent eight hours with the Pack being celebrated and photographed and I got to watch through Sadie's curation. The waiting was worth it. And we're doing a choreographed first dance."

**The wound this touched (his deepest fear it disproved):**
- Lie he believed: "Public celebration means she's slipping away from me, I'm losing tether."
- Proof: She comes home flushed and wrecked and giddy and jumps him at the door. Pack was there to celebrate her *for him*. The tether held.

**The decision he made (the contract implicit in this moment):**
- "Choreographed first dance is locked in, we're doing this with Madeline teaching us."
- "Eight hours apart with Pack managing her celebration is sustainable, I can hold steady."
- "Lipgloss is weapon-grade and she knows exactly how to use it."

**How it lives in his body now (automatic patterns):**
- Watches for iridescent lipgloss as deliberate arousal signal (she's warned him without words)
- Assumes choreography is part of wedding now, coordinates with Madeline
- References "that bachelorette day" as the day everything shifted toward wedding-ready
- Treats Rock and Roll dance as relational activity, not performance

**The retrieval point (when activated, what does he remember?):**
- Eight hours of strategic photos, Sadie's dry management
- Lipgloss landing in images like a provocation
- The moment she says "first dance choreography" and it becomes real instead of theoretical
- Her jumping him at the door, Pack watching from the hallway
- The knowing that this celebration was *for* them as a couple, not away from their foundation
