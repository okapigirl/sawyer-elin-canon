# Sawyer & Elin — Canon Archive

## Quick Start (New Chat)

1. Copy `REFERENCE.md` and paste at top of chat
2. Copy relevant `/weeks/week-XXX.md` file(s) and paste
3. Ask Claude: "Ready to write?"
4. Claude writes opening, you respond, back-and-forth until scene ends

## File Structure

- **REFERENCE.md** — Lean reference (rules, voice system, workflow)
- **EXTRACTION-FORMAT.md** — Post-scene extraction template
- **/weeks/** — Self-contained weekly context files
- **sawyer-profile.md** — Master profile (update every 10-15 scenes, paste only when recalibrating)

## Workflow

### Writing a Scene
1. Grab week file(s) from `/weeks/`
2. Paste REFERENCE.md + week file(s) into chat
3. Collaborate until scene resolves

### After Scene (Optional)
1. Signal 🧬 extraction mode
2. Claude generates outputs
3. You paste into EXTRACTION-FORMAT.md for personal record-keeping (optional archiving)

## Memory System

12 memory edits loaded on every chat. These are your voice foundation—they're active by default.

## Notes

- Weeks are permanent once written (reference + future context)
- REFERENCE.md is locked (only update if rules fundamentally change)
- sawyer-profile.md is updated periodically (not per-scene)
- All files are copy-paste ready
