## Active Threads

- **Montana Celebration & Wedding Planning** — post-spreadsheet celebration meeting
- **Wedding Date Framework Confirmed** — 4-6 month window locked (execution Week 207)
- **Pack Coordination Formalized** — system operational
- **Pack Intimacy Framework Established** — penalty game as embodied consent/communication practice
- **Sadie's Authority + Calibration** — orchestrating the whole field, reading systems, calling time
- **Madeline's Emotional Overflow Permission** — fully present, combusting, supported through intensity
- **Sawyer's Feral Possessiveness** — both Elin + Madeline in his lap, tracking all systems
- **Elin's Laugh as System-Override** — what Sawyer named as her magic (makes everyone lose words) enacted in real time
- **Permission Architecture** — continuous checking in becomes baseline Pack practice
- **Physical + Emotional Intimacy Simultaneous** — penalties are both (positioning affects nervous system, watching deepens connection)

## Recent Canonical Beats

- Post-spreadsheet celebration (Montana meeting with Sadie & Madeline)
- Wedding planning conversation (4-6 month window confirmed)
- Pack coordination formalized
- First conception cycle underway
- **Pack weekend at Sadie & Madeline's place** (after Montana return)
- **Pack penalty card game** (Monday evening, living room)
  - Custom card deck with Pack-written questions/dares, Sadie sets boundaries ("No one moves without checking first")
  - Penalties are positioning/holding/watching (emotional + physical simultaneously)
  - Field work memory question (about Ben the architect) → Elin assigns penalty (Madeline in Sawyer's lap)
  - Sadie's observation question (what makes her lose composure) → Sawyer answers correctly (watching people lose their words/system override)
  - Escalating penalties: Sadie kneeling in front of Madeline, Elin's thigh contact, Sawyer's hand between Elin's legs
  - Elin's penalty for Sadie: "Watch Sawyer" (pulling her out of constant tracking mode into feeling)
  - Final penalty chain: Elin straddles Sawyer's thigh, both in his lap, all four connected, field becomes inevitable
  - Sadie calls the field: "Bedroom" (one word, gavel-clean)
  - Transition to bedroom: Sawyer feral-kissing Elin, Sadie guiding Madeline, all four entering together
- **Bedroom scene** (continuing same evening, all four, explicit sexual dynamic)
  - Sawyer dominance (feral, possessive), Elin responsive and anchored to Madeline
  - Madeline anchored to Elin + Sadie, Sadie orchestrating the whole field
  - Permission-based positioning throughout, continuous checking in from all four
  - Emotional safety held while intensity escalates
  - Pack intimacy framework established through embodied practice

## Sensory Anchors Hot This Period

- **Custom card deck:** Pack-written questions/dares, tactile object of intimacy + knowledge
- **Tea on low table:** Domestic baseline before escalation
- **Sadie's one-word "Bedroom":** Authority anchor, gavel-clean call, permission crystallized
- **Madeline in Sawyer's lap:** First layered positioning, all four connected simultaneously
- **Sawyer's hand between Elin's legs:** Feral possessiveness, public claiming (Pack witnessing)
- **Elin straddles Sawyer's thigh:** Double occupancy, both in lap, knee pressing into his arousal
- **Elin's laugh during penalty:** Real response, system lighting up, what Sawyer named (makes everyone lose words)
- **Sadie watching Sawyer:** Flipped dynamic, pulled from tracking into feeling
- **Feral kiss at transition:** Sawyer's restraint dissolving, all the teasing becoming inevitable
- **Permission checks throughout:** "Yeah?" "Green?" "Still good?" = continuous consent architecture
